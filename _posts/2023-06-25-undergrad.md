I have completed my undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore! These past three years have undoubtedly been a challenging yet incredibly rewarding journey, taking on more courses than my peers while also exploring my research interests. Looking back, I couldn't be more satisfied with the outcome. I am proud to have managed to go beyond the minimum requirements of my degree and enroll in courses in which I found interesting to expand my knowledge.  

I am immensely grateful to numerous professors, mentors and peers for guiding me in various ways throughout the course of this journey. I am also grateful to be part of the [Engineering Scholars Programme](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/escholars/) for granting me the scholarship and pushing me to complete my undergraduate degree in 3 years instead of the usual 4 years.  

As I embark on the next chapter of pursuing my Masters, I hope the next year will continue to be fulfilling and intellectually stimulating. I am excited to embrace new challenges, enhance my knowledge, and continue pushing myself to new heights.

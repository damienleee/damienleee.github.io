On this day, I successfully completed a full marathon in the [OSIM Sundown Marathon 2023](https://www.sundownmarathon.com/). Doing a marathon has always been on my bucket list as it represents an accomplishment that few have ever achieved. As someone who likes to challenge myself, I always wondered: *Can I do it?* I found the very answer on this day:

The entire (seemingly forever) duration of the run was a true test of perseverance, both mentally and physically. I am grateful to a particular friend of mine, who inspired me to sign up for this and accompanying me through a large part of the race.  

People often say "Life is a marathon". I encourage everyone to set ambitious goals in life and pursue them with grit and determination. Embrace the journey, for it is through the pursuit of our dreams that we discover our true capabilities.

On the 12 to 14 Decemeber 2022, I attended the 2022 Asian Conference on Electrochemical Power Sources (ACEPS11) as a volunteer. I have previously attended 2 conferences before this - the Singapore Catalysis Forum 2022 and the [International Conference on Materials for Humanity 2022 (MH 22)](https://mrs.org.sg/event/mh22/). However, this is the first conference in which I played an active role in helping with the organization of a conference. It was an enriching experience as I met many bright scientists from all around Asia and interacted with a few of my peers. The conference ended with a social tour to the Gardens By The Bay and a conference dinner.  
I am grateful to my supervisor from A*STAR for giving me the chance to volunteer at this conference. Looking forward to attending other conferences in the future!
